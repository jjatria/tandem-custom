function makeContinuum(mSubstrate, fields, steps, outpath, nameroot)
%MAKECONTINUUM Synthesize steps of a continuum using TandemSTRAIGHT
%
%   MAKECONTINUUM(MSUBSTRATE, FIELDS, STEPS, OUTPATH, NAMEROOT)
%
%   This function takes a morphing substrate MSUBSTRATE and generates a
%   continuum between its A and B samples by varying the TandemSTRAIGHT
%   parameters specified in the FIELDS string cell array with as many
%   steps as specified in STEPS.
%
%   The function saves the resulting steps as WAV files in the folder
%   specified in OUTPATH, using NAMEROOT as the basis for the generated
%   filenames. The file saving and naming options will probably need to
%   be modified in the future for increased generality. Meanwhile, adjust
%   to suit your own needs.
%
%   Examples
%       makeContinuum(mSubstrate, {'F0', 'time'}, 11, '/home/user/morph/', 'sound')
%
%           Will generate an 11-step continuum varying F0 and segment
%           duration and save the resulting synthesized sounds into the
%           specified folder. Each new file will have a name like
%           'sound.F0-time.01of11.wav'

%   rely on future versions working in the same way. Runs in Matlab and Octave.
